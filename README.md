# Hi there 👋

## About me
- 🏫 I am studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my [website](https://dxaviud.github.io/). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java (the second time to fill in gaps) using the [official Java tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html), C++ in one of my courses ([CS138](https://ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/2122/COURSE/course-CS.html#CS138)), and various other languages in bits and pieces.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me an [email](mailto:dxaviud@uwaterloo.ca) (you can also use [this one](mailto:d83xu@uwaterloo)).

## Some of my bigger repositories

### [anti-rona-lock-system](https://github.com/dxaviud/anti-rona-lock-system) 
This is a project I created with 4 four other students from my cohort. There is a hardware component to it which is in the possession of one of my teammates. It uses TensorFlow and OpenCV to analyze an image, detecting distances between people and whether they are wearing masks or not.

### [chess](https://github.com/dxaviud/chess)
I created this while in high school. I have a few video demos of it on my website. The code is completely original (and also buggy, but it works well for the most part). I plan on redoing the saving feature in the future, which currently just writes/reads to/from a text file.

### [ultimate-tictactoe](https://github.com/dxaviud/ultimate-tictactoe)
This is somewhat similar to my chess repository. I made it more recently (during the summer of 2020). Like my chess project, this one has a GUI.
