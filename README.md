# Hi there 👋

## About me
- 🏫 I’m in my 1B term for Software Engineering and seeking a 4 month co-op job for the summer.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my [website](https://dxaviud.github.io/). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript), and C++ (in my [CS138](https://ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/2122/COURSE/course-CS.html#CS138) course).
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me an [email](mailto:d83xu@uwaterloo.ca) (you can also use [this one](mailto:dxaviud@uwaterloo.ca)).

## Some of my bigger repositories

### [anti-rona-lock-system](https://github.com/dxaviud/anti-rona-lock-system) 
This is a project I created with 4 four other students from my cohort. There is a hardware component to it which is in the possession of one of my teammates. It uses TensorFlow and OpenCV to analyze an image, detecting distances between people and determining mask usage.

### [chess](https://github.com/dxaviud/chess)
I created this from scratch a while back. I have video demos of its main features on my website. All of it is completely original (except some image assets which I've borrowed and modified). I might redo the saving feature to use object streams (it currently just writes/reads to/from a text file).

### [ultimate-tictactoe](https://github.com/dxaviud/ultimate-tictactoe)
This is somewhat similar to my chess repository, but I made it more recently. Like my chess project, this one has a GUI.
