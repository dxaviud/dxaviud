# Hi there 👋

## About me
- 🏫 Finished my 1B term for Software Engineering<!-- and seeking a 4 month co-op job for the summer-->
- 🌱 Learning C# and going through freeCodeCamp's curriculum (here's my [profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/dxaviud))
- 📫 Reach me: Send me an [email](mailto:d83xu@uwaterloo.ca) (you can also use [this one](mailto:dxaviud@uwaterloo.ca))
<!--, [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)-->


## Current project(s)

### [bug-tracker](https://github.com/dxaviud/bug-tracker)
I made it using the Flask framework w/ PostgreSQL and deployed to Heroku. It's far from being finished.

### [dxaviud.github.io](https://github.com/dxaviud/dxaviud.github.io)
My portfolio website. It's mostly finished.

## Some of my bigger repositories

### [anti-rona-lock-system](https://github.com/dxaviud/anti-rona-lock-system) 
A lock-camera system that uses machine learning and computer vision to detect masks and calculate person-to-person distances. If safety conditions are met, the lock is unlocked automatically. This is a project I created with 4 four other students from my cohort. It uses TensorFlow and OpenCV to analyze images.

### [chess](https://github.com/dxaviud/chess)
I created this from scratch a while back. I have video demos of its main features on my [porfolio website](https://dxaviud.github.io). All of it is completely original (excluding some image assets which I've borrowed and modified). I might redo the saving feature to use object streams (it currently just writes/reads to/from a text file).

### [ultimate-tictactoe](https://github.com/dxaviud/ultimate-tictactoe)
This is somewhat similar to my chess repository, but I made it more recently. Like my chess project, this one has a GUI.
