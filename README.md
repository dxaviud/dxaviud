# Hi there 👋

## About me
- 🏫 I am studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my [website](https://dxaviud.github.io/). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java (the second time) using the [official Java tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html) to fill in knowledge gaps and heighten my skills.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me an [email](mailto:dxaviud@uwaterloo.ca) (you can also use [this one](mailto:d83xu@uwaterloo))

## Some of my bigger repositories

### [anti-rona-lock-system](https://github.com/dxaviud/anti-rona-lock-system) 
- This is a project I created with 4 four other students from my cohort. There is a hardware component to it which is in the possession of one of my teammates. It uses TensorFlow and OpenCV to analyze an image, detecting people's faces and whether they are wearing masks or not.
### [chess](https://github.com/dxaviud/chess)
- I created this while in high school. I have a few video demos of it on my website. The code is original (that's probably why it's not bug-free). It's also not organized (everything is in the src folder >_<), but I do plan on refactoring much of it in the near future.
### [ultimate-tictactoe](https://github.com/dxaviud/ultimate-tictactoe)
- This is somewhat similar to my chess repository. I made it more recently (during the summer of 2020). Like my chess project, this one has a GUI.
